when it say write the programming language name
you can use letters and numbers and symbols
but don't add any:
1-spaces
2-unicode letters

and everything like these two

when it say write the fileformat don't write
the dot,let's take an example let's say you
want to make 'miki' is the name of an
fileformat you must write it like this:
miki
not like this:
.miki
